<li><b>INGREDIENTS:</b></li>
<li>1¼ cups flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
<li>4 ounces of dark chocolate chopped or broken into pieces</li>
<li>1 cup seedless raspberry jam</li>
<li>¾ cup granulated or caster sugar</li>
<li>2 large eggs beaten</li>


<li><b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b></li>
<li>Preheat to oven to 350°F (180°C or 170°C for a fan oven).
Butter a 20 cm (8 inch) springform cake pan and line the bottom with baking parchment.
Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Keep an eye on it, you don't want browned butter!</li>
<li>Stir in the chocolate with a wooden spoon and continue stirring as it begins to melt.
Before the chocolate is completely melted, remove the pan from the heat.
Stir until the butter and chocolate are thoroughly combined.
Stir in the jam, sugar and beaten eggs, combining thoroughly.
Beat in the dry ingredients which you set aside earlier. Do this in three additions, beating until the batter in relatively smooth..</li>
<li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean. .
Cool in the pan on a rack for ten minutes before turning out on to the rack to cool.</li>
<li>You can eat the cake warm if you don't want to decorate it with icing sugar but if you wish to pretty it up a bit you need to let it cool completely first. I suggest carefully turning the cake over before decorating and serving.
Store in a covered container for up to 4 days.</li>
